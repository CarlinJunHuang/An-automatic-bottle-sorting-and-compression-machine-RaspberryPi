# SDM242_Group5
2022 Fall SDM242 @Prof.Xiaoping Hong
# Background
This is the Github page of the fifth group in SDM242, Fall semester 2022.

The code in this home page covers the use of infrared sensors, inductive proximity switches, programmable LED light strips, electronic pulser handwheels, Raspberry PI stepper motors, 42 stepper motors, and 86 stepper motors.

These are the components and solutions we used/tried to use in the big project "Visual Beverage Bottle Sorting Compressor" in the semester.

See folder "Final_Program" for the whole final program.

# Details
If you want to replicate the functionality of the prototype we've done, you may need to use some of the following (recommended) components:

1. AC 220V to DC 24V/5V 150W power supply;
2. Raspberry PI;
3. 86 stepper motor with torque of at least 4Nm;
4. DMA860H drive;
5. Any 42 stepper motor;
6. TB6600 drive;
7. Infrared sensor;
8. Inductive proximity switch;
9. And... Maybe a computer is needed.

PS: The sensors mentioned in 7 and 8 can be purchased by yourself or made by referring to the samples in the "PCB" folder.

In addition, you may need some mechanical mechanism that can complete the given motion. Some of the main mechanisms I use are: screw lifting platform, slider platform and so on.

# References
In order to accomplish the goal of this final project, I looked up a lot of information on the Internet. Thanks all the kind ppl on the network for selfless dedication of their knowledge!

Followings are some of the most important references that have inspired me the most. I hope it also works for you!
